## How to Reach Tirana

**BY AIR** | Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza (TIA), also known as Rinas Airport, is the main gateway to Albania. Located about 17 km northwest of the city, it offers direct flights from many European hubs including Rome, Istanbul, Vienna, and London. The airport is connected to the city centre by taxi (30–40 minutes) or the shuttle, which runs every hour and drops you near Skanderbeg Square.

**BY BUS** | Tirana is well connected by regional and international buses. Long-distance buses arrive at various informal terminals around the city, depending on the direction of travel (e.g. South, North, or international). Domestic buses also run frequently from cities like Shkodra, Durrës, and Saranda.

**BY TRAIN** | Train travel is unavailable in Albania.

## Public Transport in Tirana

- Good public transport. Buses are cash-only and you pay the conductor on board. Within Tirana, Google Maps show reliable bus connections and timings.
- Shuttles run by LUNA.shpk connect the airport to central Tirana.

**TIP:** Cash is king in Tirana. The Albanian LEK is a closed currency, so you can only exchange it after entering Albania. Remember to spend all cash or exchange all LEK before departing.

## Budget Stays

- [Hotel La Favorita](https://www.booking.com/hotel/al/europa-tirane.en.html?aid=8003075&no_rooms=1&group_adults=2) - We stayed here and recommend it. It is close to Skanderbeg Square. Rooms are basic but clean and spacious. Service is good.
